//This is of course shorter and easier to read than the "old" way of concatenating strings:
//With that syntax, we can dynamically add data into a string like this.
//Instead of using double or single quotation marks: 'A String' or "Another string", we can use backticks (`)


console.log("My name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old.");
//this is the old way or conventinal way of writing strings
